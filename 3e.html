            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <div class="about-us">
                <p> Hi! We are the hosts of FilmGeeks, three passionate film lovers eager to share our love for cinema
                    and
                    series with the world.</p>
                <p>What started as endless conversations about the latest films and our favorite shows grew into this
                    podcast, where we embark on a shared quest
                    for the best viewing recommendations.
                    Though our backgrounds may differ—one of us is a huge fan of indie
                    films and arthouse, while another is addicted
                    to blockbusters and binge-worthy series—our shared love for storytelling unites us.
                    Together, we bring a wide range of perspectives, from in-depth analyses to lighthearted and humorous
                    discussions.We understand how overwhelming it can be to choose the right movie or show, especially
                    when
                    your mood plays such a big role.
                    That's why we started this podcast: to help you in that search, with personal and sincere
                    recommendations that fit how you're feeling at the moment.
                    Whether you're in the mood to rediscover a classic or eager to check out a new release,
                    we'll make sure you find something that perfectly suits your mood. With Filmgeeks, we don't just aim
                    to
                    review films and series; we want to create a space where movie lovers feel right at home.
